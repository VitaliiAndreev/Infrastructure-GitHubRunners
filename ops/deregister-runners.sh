# Operator wrapper for the deregister-runners flow. Mirrors
# register-runners.sh: same GH_TOKEN acquisition (require_gh_token), same
# CA_EXTRA_VAULTS=GitHubRunners + CA_REQUIRES_TOKEN=1 contract for the vault
# read, same CA_CONSUMER_ROOT so the bridge runs this repo's
# deregister-runners playbook, roles, and GitHubRunners fragment. Two
# deliberate differences from the register entry:
#
# - CA_NEEDS_HOST_FILE_SERVER stays unset and no tarball is staged. The down
#   path fetches nothing from the Windows side, so spawning the HttpListener
#   would be a port and a failure surface (port-in-use, switch IP absent) for
#   no consumer.
# - The wrapper owns one flag of its own, --force, consumed here and
#   translated to --extra-vars runners_force_remove=true for
#   ansible-playbook. The translation lives here (not at the playbook
#   default) so the operator-facing surface stays a single switch regardless
#   of how the playbook expresses it. Mirrors today's PowerShell -Force
#   one-for-one.
