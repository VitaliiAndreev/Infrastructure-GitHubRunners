rem Explorer-double-click launcher for ops/register-runners.sh. Mirror
rem of deregister-runners.bat: the .sh is the real entry; this .bat
rem exists so an operator can run the register-runners flow without
rem first opening a WSL terminal.
rem
rem _find-bash.bat from Common-Automation locates Git Bash robustly and
rem sets %BASH%; reused rather than reimplemented (the lookup probes
rem several install layouts and has its own rationale comments).
rem Common-Automation is expected as a sibling checkout under the same
rem parent directory as this repo - same convention used by
rem scripts/run-tests.bat.
rem
rem We hold the window open here with `pause` so Explorer-click users
rem can read the play recap; the .sh itself stays quiet on exit.
