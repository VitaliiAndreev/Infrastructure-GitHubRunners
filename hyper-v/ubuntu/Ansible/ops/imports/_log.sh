# Cross-repo adapter: imports the shared logger (log_info / log_warn /
# log_err) from Common-Automation (scripts/log.sh, which owns the colour
# single source of truth via colors.sh). Sourcing this is how every ops/
# script pulls in the logger on a stable in-repo path while the cross-repo
# location stays resolved in one place. See _common-automation-root.sh for
# how the repo root is found and overridden under test.
