# Operator wrapper: report whether each declared GitHub Actions runner is
# "up" - its on-VM systemd unit is active AND GitHub shows it online.
#
# Read-only counterpart to register-runners.sh / deregister-runners.sh: same
# GH_TOKEN acquisition (require_gh_token), same CA_EXTRA_VAULTS=GitHubRunners
# + CA_REQUIRES_TOKEN=1 contract for the GitHubRunnersConfig vault read the
# status play needs, and the same CA_CONSUMER_ROOT so the bridge runs this
# repo's runner-status playbook and roles. No --force / no host file server -
# nothing is changed or fetched. Every other arg is forwarded to
# ansible-playbook, so `--limit ubuntu-02-ci` narrows the check to one VM.
#
# Report-only: a DOWN runner is a normal result, so the exit code mirrors
# ansible-playbook's - 0 on a clean run even with runners down, non-zero only
# on an actual error (missing token, unreachable controller, malformed config).

# The play colours its UP/DOWN report with ANSI inside debug msgs, but
# Ansible's default callback JSON-encodes task results, so each ESC byte
# arrives here as a literal backslash-u-001b escape (so a red marker shows
# up as the visible text [31m). Translate it back to a real ESC so the
# green / red renders. The translation lives in the wrapper, not the play,
# because only this read-only report colours its output.
#
# Piping disables Ansible's own PLAY / TASK colour (its stdout is no longer a
# TTY), so force it back on and forward the flag across the WSL re-exec
# (_run-playbook.sh appends its own vars to WSLENV). pipefail keeps the
# playbook's exit code as this script's - sed never fails.
