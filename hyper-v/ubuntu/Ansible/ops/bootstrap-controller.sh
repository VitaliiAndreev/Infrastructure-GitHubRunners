# The bootstrap logic is a SSOT in the Common-Ansible substrate
# (ops/bootstrap-controller-consumer.sh), reached through the sibling checkout;
# this shim only resolves the substrate and hands it this repo's Ansible-slice
# root (for the roles-path summary). Kept per-repo so `bootstrap-controller
# (Ansible)` is a uniform menu entry across the substrate consumers.
