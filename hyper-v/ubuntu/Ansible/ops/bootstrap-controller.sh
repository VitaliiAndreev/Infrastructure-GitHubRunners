# Consumer-side controller bootstrap for Infrastructure-GitHubRunners. Runs
# inside WSL.
#
# This repo consumes Common-Ansible as a sibling checkout: the substrate's
# reusable roles AND its ops bridge are reached from one resolved root (see
# ops/imports/_common-ansible-root.sh). The roles are not standalone - they
# read the bridge's extra-vars/inventory contract - so roles and bridge are
# taken together through the one checkout, not split across transports.
#
# The bootstrap is thin: it (1) locates the substrate sibling and (2) makes
# sure the shared controller (the venv + ansible-core + substrate collections
# that Common-Ansible's own bootstrap builds) exists, reusing it rather than
# forking it. There is nothing to install for this repo - the runner roles
# live in this repo's roles/ and resolve at play time: the flow wrappers
# declare CA_CONSUMER_ROOT and the substrate bridge puts this repo's roles/
# ahead of the substrate's on ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH (see the README).
